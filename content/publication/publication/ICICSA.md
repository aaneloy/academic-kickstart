An Automated Mobile Robot can navigate on a floor freely by avoiding obstacles and walking on
the shortest path between two points. It uses a vector map of the floor and Dijkstra's shortest path
algorithm for calculating shortest path. For obstacle avoidance, it uses ultrasonic sensor modules and preloaded
intelligence. The RFID scanner is used for identification and verification of destination and recalibrating
position of the robot on a path by detecting other locations on the path. This system requires
195 RPM and 1.75 seconds duration for the robot to successfully read the RFID tag.</div>
